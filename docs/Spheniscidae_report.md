# Taxon Spheniscidae

## I. Query data
There are 25 species in the Open Tree of Life Taxonomy for the taxon Spheniscidae.
Information on time of divergence is available for
19
of these species across 13 published and peer-reviewed chronograms.
Original study citations as well as proportion of Spheniscidae species found across those source
chronograms is shown in Table 1.

All source chronograms are fully ultrametric.

## II. Summarize results.
### II.A. Diagnosing clustering issues.

We identified some issues with chronograms coming from SDM and Median summary matrices.
First, clustering algorithms used to go from a summary distance matrix to
a tree return trees that are too old (generally with UPGMA algorithms) or non-ultrametric
(generally with Neighbour Joining algorithms). In most studied cases, UPGMA returns
fully ultrametric trees but with very old ages (we had to multiply the matrix by
0.25 to get ages approximate to source chronograms ages, however this is a number
chosen at random, it was just the number that worked well). NJ returned reasonable
ages, but trees are way non ultrametric, as you can see in Fig. 3
and Fig. 4.

This taxon's SDM matrix has some negative values in the following taxa: *Eudyptes chrysocome*, *Eudyptes filholi*. This taxon's Median matrix has NO negative values.


![Spheniscidae lineage through time (LTT) plots from source chronograms and Median summary matrix converted to phylo with different methods (NJ and UPGMA).  Clustering algorithms used often are returning non-ultrametric trees or with maximum ages that are just off (too old or too young). So we developped an alternative algorithm in `datelife` to go from a summary matrix to a fully ultrametric tree.](plots/Spheniscidae_LTTplot_Median.pdf)



![Spheniscidae lineage through time (LTT) plots from source chronograms and SDM summary matrix converted to phylo with different methods (NJ and UPGMA). As you can note, dashed lines and solid lines from trees coming out from both types of clustering algorithms implemented are mostly overlapping. This means that removing negative values does not change results from clustering algorithms much. Clustering algorithms used often are returning non-ultrametric trees or with maximum ages that are just off (too old or too young). So we developped an alternative algorithm in `datelife` to go from a summary matrix to a fully ultrametric tree.](plots/Spheniscidae_LTTplot_SDM.pdf)

### II.B. Age distributions form Median and SDM summary trees.

## III. Create new data


As an example, we're gonna date the Open Tree Synthetic tree (mainly because the taxonomic tree is usually less well resolved.)


Now, let's say you like the Open Tree of Life Taxonomy and you want to stick to that tree. Dates from available studies were tested over the Open Tree of Life Synthetic tree of Spheniscidae and a tree was constructed, but all branch lengths are NA.
We also tried  each source chronogram independently, with the Dated OToL and with each other, as a form of cross validation in Table 2. This is not working perfectly yet, but we are developping new ways to use all calibrations efficiently.

\begin{table}[t]

## III. Simulate data
An alternative to generate a dated tree from a set of taxa is to take the available information and simulate into it the missing data.
We will take the median and sdm summary chronograms to date the Synthetic tree of Life:

```
#> Error in paste0("\n![", figcap_lttplot_sdm, "](plots/", taxon, "_LTTplot_sdm.pdf)\n"): object 'figcap_lttplot_sdm' not found
#> Error in cat(lttplot): object 'lttplot' not found
```

## Appendix
The following species were completely absent from the chronogram data base:  *Aptenodytes australis**, **Catadyptes chrysolophus**, **Eudyptes atratus**, **Eudyptula chathamensis**, **Megadyptes waitaha**, **Pygoscelis ellsworthi*
