# Taxon Cetacea

## 1. Query source chronograms
There are 198 species in the Open Tree of Life Taxonomy for the taxon Cetacea.
Information on time of divergence is available for
89
of these species across 6 published and peer-reviewed chronograms.
Original study citations as well as number of Cetacea species found across those source
chronograms is shown in Table 1. All source chronograms are fully ultrametric and their maximum 
ages range from 33.5 to
55.5 million years ago (MYA).
As a means for comparison, lineage through time plots of all source chronograms
available in data base are shown in Fig. 1


## 2. Summarize results from query

LTT plots are a nice way to visually compare several trees. But what if you want
to summarize information from all source chronograms into a single summary chronogram?

The first step is to identify the degree of species overlap among your source chornograms: if each
source chronogram has a unique sample of species, it will not be possible to combine
them into a single summary chronogram. To identify the set of trees or _grove_ with the most source
chronograms that have at least two overlapping taxa, we followed An√© et al. 2016.
In this case, not all source chronograms found for the  Cetacea  have at least two overlapping species. The largest grove has  2  chronograms (out of  6  total source chronograms).

Now that we have identified a grove 
we can go on to summarize it by translating the source chronograms into patristic distance matrices and
then averaging them into a single summary matrix; yes, this first step is _that_
straightforward. We can average the source matrices by simply using the mean or
median distances, or we can use methods that involve transforming
the original distance matrices --such as the super distance matrix (SDM) approach of Criscuolo et al. 2006-- by minimizing
the distances across source matrices. As a result of such transformation, an SDM
summary matrix can contain negative values. In this case, the SDM summary matrix has some negative values in the following taxa: *Eubalaena japonica*, *Eubalaena glacialis*. 

Because our summary matrix is basically a distance matrix, a distance-based clustering
algorithm could be used to reconstruct the tree. Algorithms such as neighbour joining (NJ) and
unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) are
fast and work very well when there are no missing values in the matrices. However, summary
matrices coming from source chronograms usually have several NAs and missing rows.
<!--This data set for example has NUMBER cells with missing data.-->
When this happens, variants of traditional clustering algorithms have been developed to deal with missing values.
<!--
NJS: ape::njs
UPGMA: daisy + upgma
BIONJ: ape::bionjs(X)
Minimum Variance Reduction: ape::mvrs(X, V)
Triangle Method, Tree reconstruction based on the triangle method: ape::triangMtds(X)
-->
However, even these methods do not work well with our summary matrices, as shown in the following section.
We should note that these clustering methods are usually applied to distance matrices representing substitution rates
and not absolute time.

###   2.1. Clustering a summary matrix

NJ, UPGMA, BIONJ, minimum variance reduction (MVR) and the triangle method (TM)
algorithms were used to cluster median and SDM summary distance matrices.
All clustering algorithms returned very similar trees with both types of summary
matrices (Fig. 2, Appendix Fig. 5).
UPGMA is the only algorithm that returns ultrametric trees, but they are considerably
older than expected from source chronograms.
The other methods returned trees with reasonable ages, but that are not ultrametric.
An alternative to clustering algorithms is to use all data avilable in the summary
matrix as calibrations over a consensus tree.


###   2.2. Calibrating a consensus tree with data from a summary matrix

Even if the branch lengths coming form the clustered chronograms are not adequate,
the topology can still be used as a backbone tree that can be dated using data from
the summary matrix as secondry calibrations.
A summary of divergence times available for each node can be obtained from the summary matrix,
simply by getting the nodes from the backbone tree that correspond to each pair of
taxa in the matrix. Finally, this summary of node divergence times can be used with
the consensus tree as input in any dating software that does not require data.
The branch length aduster (BLADJ) algorithm [@Webb2000] is really fast and does
not make any evolutionary assumptions on age distribution. Other software such as
MrBayes and r8s can be used instead of BLADJ by running them without data.
In here, we show summary chronograms obtained using minimum, mean and maximum distances
from the summary of node divergence times of the backbone tree as fixed ages in
BLADJ (Fig. 3).
Summary chronograms from both types of summary matrices are quite similar. As expected,
SDM chronograms using minimum, mean and maximum distances do not vary much in their
maximum age, because ages are transformed to minimize the variance. In contrast,
the median chronograms obtained with minimum, mean and maximum distances have wider variation
in their maximum ages, as can be observed in the distance between the green arrows
in Fig. 3.


## 3. Generate new chronograms

Another way to leverage information from the source chronograms is to use the node
ages as secondary calibration points to date any tree topology (with or without
branch lengths) given that at least two taxa from source chronograms are in
the tips of that topology.
In this data set we have 425 calibrations in total (that basically
corresponds to the sum of the number of nodes from each source chronogram).
Once we have a target tree topology, we can map the calibrations to the target tree.
Some nodes will have several calibrations and some others might have none. Also,
some node ages can be conflicting, with descendant nodes being older than parent nodes.
We performed a series of cross validation analyses with different dating methods by
dating the topologies of each source chronogram using information from all other
source chronograms as calibration points.

### 3.1. Calibrate a backbone tree without branch lengths
To date a tree in the absence of data on relative evolutionary rates (molecular
or morphological) we follow the same methodology as the one used to obtain summary
chronograms. First, we obtained the nodes that correspond to each pair of taxa in the data
set of total calibrations to construct a summary of node calibrations for the backbone
tree. Then, we used mean ages as secondary calibrations for the backbone tree with
the software BLADJ. In general, the time of divergence information from other source
chronograms allows to recover the divergence times from the original study. In some cases,
it is evident that information from a particular study really affects the summary
of divergence times. In some other cases, the root of the tree is not calibrated.
Since BLADJ has no underlying model of evolution, there is no way for the algorithm
to calculate this age. So, we simply added a unit of the mean difference across
ranked ages from secondary calibrations (Fig. 4)

### 3.2. Calibrate a tree with data
If you have atree with branch lengths proportional to relative substitution rates, you can use PATHd8
You can get data on relative substitution rates from BOLD using DAteLife's functions.
To deal with conflicting calibrations, we can expand them to make them agree, or we can summarize them.

### 3.2.1. Expanding calibrations


### 3.2.2. Summarizing calibrations


### 4. Example with subspecies tree
As an example, we're gonna date the subspecies tree of the group (coming from otol).


Now, let's say you like the Open Tree of Life Taxonomy and you want to stick to
that tree. Dates from available studies were tested over the Open Tree of Life
Synthetic tree of Cetacea and a tree was constructed, but all branch lengths are NA.
We also tried  each source chronogram independently, with the Dated OToL and with
each other, as a form of cross validation in Table 2. This is not working
perfectly yet, but we are developping new ways to use all calibrations efficiently.


## 5. Simulate data/ Add missing taxa
An alternative to generate a dated tree from a set of taxa is to take the available information and simulate into it the missing data.
We will take the median and sdm summary chronograms to date the Synthetic tree of Life:
